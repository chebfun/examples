%% Introduction
% Rotating functions defined on the sphere has applications in many fields,
% including quantum mechanics, inverse scattering, and integral equations.
% Spherefun now has a fast |rotate| command that allows one to 
% efficiently rotate functions. For example, the code below plots the
% function $f(x,y,z) = \cos(50z) + x^2$, where $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$, and
% a rotated version (details on how to specify the rotation are given
% below).
f = spherefun(@(x,y,z) cos(50*z) + x.^2); 
g = rotate(f, -pi/4, pi/2, pi/8);
subplot(1,2,1)
FS = 'fontsize'; fs = 26;
plot( f ), title('Original',FS,fs), axis off
subplot(1,2,2)
plot( g ), title('Rotated',FS,fs), axis off

%% 
% The |rotate| command requires a highly
% nontrivial computation, because the rotated function must be represented 
% by an approximant in the original coordinate system. This allows one to 
% continue to do algebraic manipulations on the rotated function. For 
% example, convenient algebraic manipulations. 
h = f + g;    
clf, plot( h ), axis off

%%
% The |rotate| command computes the rotated function essentially to machine 
% precision. For instance, the 2D integral over the sphere is preserved:
abs( sum2(f) - sum2(g) )

%% Euler angles 
% The command accepts rotations described in terms of Euler
% angles, denoted by $(\phi,\theta,\psi)$ in the so-called ZXZ
% convention. That is, the rotation is: first rotate about the $z$-axis
% by an angle $\phi$, then rotate about the (original) $x$-axis by an
% angle $\theta$, then about the new $z$-axis by an angle $\psi$. All
% angles should be given in radians. For example, here are the rotations
% corresponding to the Euler angles $(\pi/4,0,0)$,  $(0,\pi/4,0)$, and
% $(\pi/4,0,\pi/4)$:

f = spherefun(@(x,y,z) cos(50*x.*(y-.5)));
subplot(2,2,1)
plot( f ), title('Original',FS,fs), axis off
subplot(2,2,2)
g = rotate( f, pi/4, 0, 0);
plot( g ), title('Rotated \phi=\pi/4',FS,fs), axis off
subplot(2,2,3)
g = rotate( f, 0, pi/4, 0);
plot( g ), title('Rotated \theta=\pi/4',FS,fs), axis off
subplot(2,2,4)
g = rotate( f, pi/4, 0, pi/4);
plot( g ), title('Rotated \phi=\psi=\pi/4',FS,fs), axis off

%% 
% Every rigid-body rotation of the sphere can be described in terms of
% these three Euler angles. 

%% Rotation using the spherical harmonic expansions
% The classical algorithm for computing the rotation of a function $f$ on the 
% sphere is to first express $f$ in terms of a spherical harmonic expansion 
% and then to use the fact that the spherical harmonics form a basis of SO(3) [4].
% For example, if $f$ is the spherical harmonic function 
% $Y_{\ell}^m(\lambda,\theta)$, then any rotation of 
% $Y_{\ell}^m(\lambda,\theta)$ can be written as a linear combination of 
% $Y_{\ell}^s(\lambda,\theta)$ for $-\ell\leq s\leq \ell$ in the original 
% coordinate system. That is, 
%
% $$ Y_{\ell}^m(\lambda',\theta') = \sum_{s=-\ell}^{\ell}
% A_{ms}Y_{\ell}^s(\lambda,\theta), $$
% 
% where $(\lambda',\theta')$ is in the rotated coordinated system. Since 
% the above linear combination only involves $Y_{\ell}^s(\lambda,\theta)$ 
% for $-\ell\leq s\leq \ell$ (for the same parameter $\ell$), it can be used 
% to derive a fast algorithm for rotating functions on the sphere.

%% 
% We can verify the above statements by computing the spherical harmonic
% coefficients of $Y_{10}^{3}$ after a rotation with Euler angles
% $(\pi/4,\pi/3,-\pi/8)$:
eulerAngles = [pi/4, pi/3, -pi/8]; 
f = spherefun.sphharm( 10, 3 ); 
g = rotate(f, eulerAngles(1), eulerAngles(2), eulerAngles(3));

% Compute the spherical harmonic coefficients of g:
N = 12; k = 1;
coeffs = zeros((N+1)^2,3);
for l = 0:N
    for m = -l:l
        Y = spherefun.sphharm(l,m);
        coeffs(k,1) = sum2(g.*Y);
        coeffs(k,2:3) = [l m];
        k = k + 1;
    end
end
clf

title('Spherical harmonic coefficients')

%%
% We see that only the $\ell=10$ coefficients have changed.  We can verify
% this further by computing the rotated spherical harmonic directly as a
% linear combination of $Y_{\ell}^s(\lambda,\theta)$ for $-\ell\leq s\leq
% \ell$.
h = spherefun(0); 
k = 1;
for m = -10:10
    h = h + coeffs((9+1)^2 + k,1)*spherefun.sphharm(10,m);
    k = k + 1;
end
norm(h - g)

%% An alternative rotate algorithm based on the 2D NUFFT
% While spherical harmonic expansions present a natural approach for 
% representing functions on the sphere, Spherefun does not use them.  
% Instead it uses the double Fourier sphere method with a low rank
% technique (based on a structure-preserving Gaussian elimination
% procedure) for approximating functions on the sphere to essentially
% machine precision [3].  This method allows us to employ fast transforms
% based on the FFT with no setup costs, unlike fast spherical harmonic
% transforms [2], and provides highly adaptive discretizations.

%%
% Since Spherefun does not use spherical harmonics, it cannot directly use
% the rotation technique described above. The implementation of |rotate| 
% in Spherefun is instead based on a two-dimensional
% nonuniform FFT (NUFFT) [1], which makes for a fast rotation algorithm.

%% 
% The approach we use in the |rotate| command is to evaluate the function 
% on a rotated tensor product grid and then call the Spherefun 
% constructor.  The NUFFT allows this evaluation to be done in near 
% optimal complexity.  The |rotate| command has an optional input that allows
% one to compare the naive approach to our NUFFT approach.   

%%
% To illustrate the speed-up that can be achieved with the NUFFT, we 
% consider the following ``random'' function on the sphere:
f = randnfunsphere( 0.03 ); 
plot( f ), title('Random function',FS,fs), axis off

%%
% For this function, we see a big speed-up for the NUFFT:
s = tic; g = rotate(f, pi/3, pi/2, 0.5, 'feval'); t_feval = toc(s); 
s = tic; h = rotate(f, pi/3, pi/2, 0.5); t_nufft = toc(s);
fprintf('NUFFT speed-up factor = %2.1f\n', t_feval/t_nufft)
plot( h ), title('Rotated random function',FS,fs), axis off

%% 
% We hope that this speed-up allows for successful applications of the 
% |rotate| command. 

%% Ranks of rotated functions
% Spherefun computations are based on exploiting an underlying low rank
% structure of functions on the sphere. For example, the following 
% function on the sphere is mathematically a full rank function
% that can be approximated to essentially machine precision by a rank 
% $29$ function:

f = spherefun(@(x,y,z) cos(100*x.*y));
rank( f )

%%
% Similar to the rotated functions in Figure 3.1 of [5],
% we find that the required rank
% is sensitive to the orientation of the function. For example, here we 
% barely rotate a function, but increase its numerical rank by a factor of
% $2.5$.

g = rotate(f, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01);
rank(g)

%%
% In particular, there is no mathematical relationship between the rank of
% the original function and its rotation. This means that the |rotate|
% command cannot take advantage of the low rank structure of a function. Here,
% is a rotation that increases the rank by about a factor of $5$: 

g = rotate(f, pi/4, -pi/3, -pi/8);
rank(g)

%%
% As a final example to show how the rank can change as the function is
% rotated, we consider a Gaussian function restricted to the sphere.  
% We start with the Gaussian slightly offset from the $y$-axis
% and then rotate it over the $x$-axis and track how the rank changes.
cntr = -[sin(0.1) cos(0.1)];
f = spherefun(@(x,y,z) exp(-10*((x-cntr(1)).^2+(y-cntr(2)).^2+z.^2)));
alp = linspace(0,2*pi,101); rk = zeros(size(alp));
for k=1:length(alp)
    g = rotate(f, 0, alp(k), 0);
    rk(k) = rank(g);
end
plot(alp,rk,'x-','LineWidth',2), xlabel('Rotation angle',FS,fs)
ylabel('Rank'), title('Rank of the rotation of a Gaussian',FS,fs)

%%
% As the Gaussian approaches the north and south poles (at rotation angles
% of $\pi/2$ and $3\pi/2$, respectively) we see that the rank decreases
% substantially. If we had not offset the Gaussian from the $y$-axis
% then the rank would have been exactly 1 at north and south poles since
% the Gaussian reduces to $\exp(-20(1\pm z))$ there.
