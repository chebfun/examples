%% 1. Introduction
% Spherefun has about 100 commands for computing with
% scalar- and vector-valued functions [1]. There is also some
% functionality for solving partial differential equations with the
% |poisson| and |helmholtz| commands.  In this example, we show how the
% latter can be used to solve the heat equation on the
% sphere using an implicit time-stepping scheme.

%%
% The example code presented here can easily be adapted to solve more
% complicated equations involving diffusion.

%% 2. Heat equation on the sphere

%%
% <latex>
% The heat equation on the sphere is defined by
% \begin{equation}
%     u_t  =  \alpha\nabla^2 u,
% \end{equation}
% where $\nabla^2$ is the surface Laplacian (Laplace-Beltrami) operator and
% $\alpha>0$ is the coefficient of thermal diffusivity.  The definition is
% completed by imposing an initial condition $u(\lambda,\theta,0) =
% u_0(\lambda,\theta,0)$, where $-\pi \leq \lambda \leq \pi$ is the
% longitudinal coordinate on the sphere and $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$ is the
% latitudinal coordinate.
% </latex>

%% 3. Implicit time discretization

%%
% <latex>
% In this example we consider discretizing (1) using the second-order
% backward differentiation formula (BDF2). In this method, the
% time derivative $u_t$ in (1) is replaced by the second-order accurate
% approximation $u_t \approx (3u_{n+1} - 4u_{n} + u_{n-1})/(2\Delta t)$,
% where $\Delta t$ is the time step and $u_n$ denotes the (approximate)
% solution at time $t=n\Delta t$. Substituting this into (1) and
% solving for $u_{n+1}$ gives the following partial differential equation
% (PDE) for the approximate solution $u_{n+1}$:
%  \begin{equation}
%  3 u_{n+1} - 2\Delta t \alpha \nabla^2 u_{n+1} = 4 u_{n} - u_{n-1}.
%  \end{equation}
% This equation can be rearranged as follows to reveal that it is a
% standard Helmholtz equation:
% \begin{equation}
% \nabla^2 u_{n+1} + K^2 u_{n+1} = \frac{K^2}{3}(4 u_{n} - u_{n-1}),
% \end{equation}
% where $K^2 = -3/(2 \Delta t \alpha)$.
% </latex>

%%
% The Spherefun command |helmholtz| can be used to solve (3)
% with optimal complexity [2].

%% 4. An example with an analytic solution

%%
% <latex>
% We first consider solving (1) with an initial condition given by the
% following sum of spherical harmonics $Y_{\ell}^{m}(\lambda,\theta)$:
% $$ u_0(\lambda,\theta,0) = Y_{6}^{0}(\lambda,\theta) +
% \sqrt{\frac{14}{11}} Y_{6}^{5}(\lambda,\theta), $$
% which is sometimes called the soccer ball function.  First, we
% construct this initial condition in Spherefun and plot it.
% </latex>

u0 = spherefun.sphharm(6,0) + sqrt(14/11)*spherefun.sphharm(6,5);
plot(u0), colormap(jet), caxis([-0.5 1]), colorbar, axis('off')

%%
% <latex>
% Since $Y_{\ell}^{m}$ is an eigenfunction of the surface Laplacian
% with eigenvalue $-\ell(\ell+1)$, the exact solution to (1) with the above
% initial condition is
% $$ u(\lambda,\theta,t) = e^{-42\alpha t} u_0(\lambda,\theta). $$
% </latex>

%%
% The code below solves (1) numerically with the discretization given in
% (3) to time $t=1$ using a time step of $\Delta t = 0.01$ and $\alpha=1/42$.
% Note that to bootstrap the BDF2 method (2) we first solve for $u_1$ using
% one step of BDF1 (backward Euler).

dt = 0.01;                         % Time step
tfinal = 1;                        % Stopping time
nsteps = ceil(tfinal/dt);          % Number of time steps
m = 20;                            % Spatial discretization
alpha = 1/42;                      % Diffusion constant
up = u0;                           % Previous time step

% Do one step of backward Euler
K = sqrt(1/(dt*alpha))*1i;         % Helmholtz frequency for BDF1
u = spherefun.helmholtz(K^2*up, K, m, m);

K = sqrt(3/(2*dt*alpha))*1i;       % Helmholtz frequency for BDF2
for n = 2:nsteps
    rhs = K^2/3*(4*u - up);
    up = u;
    u = spherefun.helmholtz(rhs, K, m, m);
    
    % Plot the solution every 25 time steps
    if ( mod(n, 25) == 0 )
        plot( u ), colormap(jet), caxis([-0.5 1])
        title(sprintf('Time %1.2f',n*dt)), colorbar, axis('off'), snapnow
    end
end

%%
% The difference between the true solution and the computed solution is
utrue = exp(-42*alpha*tfinal)*u0;
norm(u-utrue)

%%
% The error here is dominated by temporal errors from the BDF2 method, 
% as opposed to spatial discretization errors.

%% 5. A more complicated example
% In this second example we consider an initial condition for which 
% there is no closed form solution.  We set the initial heat profile to a
% sum of Gaussian bumps:

rng(10)
u0 = spherefun([]);
for bumps = 1:5
    x0 = 2*rand-1; y0 = sqrt(1-x0^2)*(2*rand-1); z0 = sqrt(1-x0^2-y0^2);
    u0 = u0 + spherefun(@(x,y,z) exp(-30*((x-x0).^2+(y-y0).^2+(z-z0).^2)));
end
plot(u0), colormap(jet), colorbar, axis('off'), caxis([0 1])

%%
% Since the sphere has no boundary, the total amount of heat is
% conserved: 
% the mean of the solution at any time is equal to the mean of the
% the initial condition.  We repeat the code above with this new initial
% condition, but now also plot a contour that tracks the mean of the initial
% condition solution, which can be computed using the command |mean2|:

meanu0 = mean2(u0);                % Mean of initial condition
dt = 0.01;                         % Time step
tfinal = 1;                        % Stopping time
nsteps = ceil(tfinal/dt);          % Number of time steps
m = 150;                           % Spatial discretization
alpha = 1/42;                      % Diffusion constant
up = u0;                           % Previous time step

% Do one step of backward Euler
K = sqrt(1/(dt*alpha))*1i;         % Helmholtz frequency for BDF1
u = spherefun.helmholtz(K^2*up, K, m, m);

K = sqrt(3/(2*dt*alpha))*1i;       % Helmholtz frequency for BDF2
for n = 2:nsteps
    rhs = K^2/3*(4*u - up);
    up = u;
    u = spherefun.helmholtz(rhs, K, m, m);   % Helmholtz solve
    
    % Plot the solution every 25 time steps
    if ( mod(n, 25) == 0 )
        plot( u ), colormap(jet), caxis([0 1]), hold on
        contour(u,[meanu0 meanu0],'k-'), hold off
        title(sprintf('Time %1.2f',n*dt)), colorbar, axis('off'), snapnow
    end
end

%%
% The numerical scheme preserves the mean value property to machine 
% precision:
norm(meanu0 - mean2(u))

%% 6. Future
% In the future we hope to extend the technology of the new |spin2|
% command in Chebfun, which is based on exponential integrators for stiff
% PDEs, to Spherefun.  This has the potential to allow problems like the
% heat equation to be solved much more efficiently and accurately in time.
