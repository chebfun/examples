%% 1. The Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition 
% A special case of the Helmholtz-Hodge theorem states that any vector 
% field that is tangent to the sphere can be uniquely decomposed into a sum
% of a surface divergence-free component and a surface curl-free component.
% In this Example, we show how this decomposition can be computed by
% Spherefun and introduce the command |helmholtzdecomp| [2]. 

%% 
% In mathematical notation, the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition says that
% we can write any vector field tangent to the surface of the sphere 
% as the sum
% $$ \mathbf{f} = \nabla \phi + \nabla \times \psi, $$
% where $\phi$ and $\psi$ are scalar-valued potential functions that are unique
% up to a constant. Here $\nabla$ is the surface gradient on the sphere, 
% and we use the standard abuse of notation that $\nabla \times \psi$ means 
% the cross-product of the surface gradient of $\psi$ with the unit normal 
% vector, $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$, to the sphere, i.e., 
% $\hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \nabla \psi$.

%%
% The components $\phi$ and $\psi$ give useful diagnostic information about
% a flow field.  For example, for winds in the upper atmosphere, $\psi$ gives
% information about cyclonic storms, while $\phi$ can be used to detect
% high and low pressure systems [1].

%% 
% To illustrate the decomposition, we take the following 
% vector field: 
f = spherefunv( @(x,y,z) y.*z.*cos(x.*y.*z), ...
                @(x,y,z) x.*z.*sin(4*x+.1*y+5*z.^2), @(x,y,z) 1+x.*y.*z ); 
quiver3( f ), view([-36 8])

%% 
% The vector field is not tangent to the surface of the sphere, so we
% project it onto the tangent space: 
f = tangent( f ); 
quiver3( f ), view([-36 8])

%% 2. Computing the curl-free component
% Since the divergence of a curl is zero, we know that 
% $$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \nabla \cdot \nabla \phi = \nabla^2 \phi, $$
% where the last equality holds because the divergence of a gradient is the
% Laplacian. Therefore, we can solve for $\phi$ in the
% Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition as follows: 
phi = spherefun.poisson( divergence(f), 0, 251 ); 
quiver3( gradient( phi ) ), hold on,
LW = 'linewidth';
contour( phi, 'b-', LW , 2 ), 
title('Curl-free component of f')
view([-36 8]), hold off

%% 
% We confirm that this component is curl-free: 
norm( vorticity( gradient( phi ) ) ) 

%% 3. Computing the divergence-free component
% Since the vorticity (normal component of the surface curl) of a 
% gradient field on the surface of the sphere is zero, we have the identity
% $$ \hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{f}) 
% = \hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot (\nabla \times \psi). $$ 
% Using the idenity that the vorticity of the surface curl of a scalar potential
% is just the surface Laplacian of the potential, we have 
% $$ \hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{f}) = \nabla^2 \psi. $$
% Therefore, we can solve for $\psi$ in the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition
% as follows: 

psi = spherefun.poisson( vorticity(f), 0, 251 );
quiver3( curl( psi ) ), hold on,
contour( psi, 'r-', LW , 2 ), 
title('Divergence-free component of f')
view([-36 8]), hold off

%% 
% By vector identities this component is divergence-free: 
norm( divergence( curl( psi ) ) ) 

%% 4. Plotting the decomposition
% Here is a plot of the decomposition.

quiver3( curl( psi ) ), title('Divergence-free'), view([-36 8])
subplot(1,3,3)
quiver3( f ), title('Tangent vector field'), view([-36 8])

%% 
% As a sanity check we confirm that the decomposition has been successful:
h = grad( phi ) + curl( psi );
norm( f - h ) 

%% 5. The helmholtzdecomp command 
% Spherefun has a command called |helmholtzdecomp| that
% computes the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of a vector field
% that is tangent to the surface.
% Therefore, this example can be replicated with the following code: 
[phi, psi] = helmholtzdecomp( f ); 
clf, quiver( f ), hold on
contour( phi, 'b-', LW , 2 )
contour( psi, 'r-', LW , 2 )
