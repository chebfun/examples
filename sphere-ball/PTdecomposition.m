%% The Poloidal-Toroidal decomposition
% In vector calculus, the Poloidal-Toroidal (PT) decomposition [1] is a 
% restricted form of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition [3]. It states that 
% any sufficiently smooth and divergence-free vector field in the ball can 
% be expressed as the sum of a poloidal field and a toroidal field. It is 
% used in the analysis of divergence-free vector fields in geomagnetism, 
% flow visualization, and incompressible fluid simulations. 

%% 
% For a chosen unit vector $\mathbf{r}$, a toroidal field, $\mathbf{T}$, is
% one that is tangential to $\mathbf{r}$ while a poloidal field, $\mathbf{P}$, 
% is one whose curl is tangential to $\mathbf{r}$, i.e., 
%
% $$ \mathbf{r}\cdot \mathbf{T} = 0, \quad \mathbf{r}\cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{P}) = 0.$$

%% The Poloidal-Toroidal decomposition for vectors defined in the unit ball
% Let $w$ be any divergence-free vector field defined in the unit ball, 
% then the PT decomposition says that $w$ can be written as the following 
% sum:
%
% $$ w = \nabla\times\nabla\times(\mathbf{r}P_w) + \nabla\times(\mathbf{r}T_w),$$
% 
% where $P_w$ and $T_w$ are scalar-valued potential functions (called the 
% poloidal and toroidal scalars). In this setting, the natural unit vector, 
% $\mathbf{r}$, to select is the unit radial vector that points away from 
% the origin. The scalars $P_w$ and T_w$ are unique up to the addition of 
% an arbitrary function that only depends on the radial variable, $r$. 

%%
% In this Example, we show how this decomposition is computed by
% Ballfun and introduce the command |PTdecomposition| [2]. 

%% 
% To illustrate the decomposition, we take the following divergence-free
% vector field:
Pw = ballfun(@(x,y,z)cos(x.*y));
Tw = ballfun(@(x,y,z)sin(y.*z));
w = ballfunv.PT2ballfunv(Pw, Tw);
quiver( w )

%%
% We start by checking that $w$ is a divergence-free vector field:
norm( div( w ) )

%% Computing the Poloidal-Toroidal decomposition
% The scalars $P_w$ and $T_w$ are unique up to the addition of 
% an arbitrary function that only depends on the radial variable, $r$.
% A popular additional constraint is to select them so that their integral
% along each sphere of radius $1$ is zero.
%
% Under this additional restriction, they satisfy the following relations [1]:
% 
% $$\nabla_1^2 P_w = -rv_r,$$
%
% $$\nabla_1 T_w = -\Lambda_1\cdot w,$$
%
% where $\nabla_1^2$ and $\Lambda_1$ denote the dimensionless Laplacian 
% and surface curl, respectively. These operations are defined in the spherical
% coordinates $(r,\lambda,\theta)$ by
%
% $$\nabla_1^2 = \frac{1}{\sin\theta}\partial_\theta(\sin\theta\partial_\theta)
% +\frac{1}{\sin^2\theta}\partial_\lambda^2,$$
% 
% $$\Lambda_1\cdot w = \frac{1}{\sin\theta}[\partial_\theta(w_\lambda\sin\theta)
% -\partial_\lambda w_\theta].$$
%
% Moreover, these constraints are imposed in the solver by requiring that
% the zeroth Fourier modes in $\lambda$ and $\theta$ are zero.
% This actually means that if $P_w$ is represented by a
% Chebyshev-Fourier-Fourier series, i.e.,
%
% $$\sum_{i=0}^n\sum_{j=-n/2}^{n/2}\sum_{k=-n/2}^{n/2}a_{i,j,k}T_i(r)e^{\mathbf{i}j\lambda}e^{\mathbf{i}k\theta},$$
%
% then $a_{i,0,0} = 0$ for $0\leq i\leq n$.

%% The PTdecomposition command
% Ballfun has a command called |PTdecomposition| that computes the 
% Poloidal-Toroidal decomposition of a divergence-free vector field.
% Therefore, the decomposition of $v$ can be computed as follows: 
[Pw, Tw] = PTdecomposition( w );
subplot(1,2,1)
plot(Pw), title('Poloidal scalar')
subplot(1,2,2)
plot(Tw), title('Toroidal scalar')

%% Visualizing the decomposition
% Here is a plot of the decomposition.
[P,T] = ballfunv.PT2ballfunv(Pw,Tw);
subplot(1,3,1) 
quiver( w ), title('Divergence-free vector field')
subplot(1,3,2)
quiver( P ), title('Poloidal component')
subplot(1,3,3)
quiver( T ), title('Toroidal component')

%% Recover the vector field from the PT scalars
% The original vector field can be recover from the poloidal and toroidal
% scalars since
%
% $$ w = \nabla\times\nabla\times(\mathbf{r}P_w) + \nabla\times(\mathbf{r}T_w).$$
%
% This operation is implemented in Ballfun in the |PT2ballfunv| command
v = ballfunv.PT2ballfunv(Pw, Tw);

%% 
% As a sanity check, we confirm that the decomposition has been successful:
norm( v - w )
