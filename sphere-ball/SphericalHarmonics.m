%% 1. Introduction
% Spherical harmonics are the spherical analogue of trigonometric
% polynomials on $[-\pi,\pi)$. The degree $\ell\geq 0$, order $m$ ($-\ell \leq m
% \leq m$) spherical harmonic is denoted by
% $Y_{\ell}^{m}(\lambda,\theta)$, and can be expressed (in real form) as
% [1, Sec. 14.30]:
% $$
% \sqrt{2} a_{\ell}^{m} P_{\ell}^{m}(\cos\theta)\cos(m\lambda),\quad m > 0
% $$
% and
% $$
% a_{\ell}^{0} P_{\ell}(\cos\theta),\quad m=0
% $$
% and
% $$
% \sqrt{2} a_{\ell}^{|m|} P_{\ell}^{|m|}(\cos\theta)\sin(m\lambda),\quad m < 0,
% $$
% where $a_{\ell}^{k}$, $0\leq k \leq \ell$, is a normalization factor
% and $P_{\ell}^{k}$, $0\leq k \leq \ell$, is the degree $\ell$,
% order $k$ associated Legendre function [1, Ch. 14].
% Here, we have used the following spherical coordinate parameterization 
% for a point ${\bf x} = (x,y,z)$ on the unit sphere:
% $$ x = \cos\lambda\sin\theta,~~ y = \sin\lambda\sin\theta,~~ z =
% \cos\theta, $$
% with $-\pi \leq \lambda \leq \pi$ and $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$.

%%
% Spherical harmonics can be derived by solving the eigenvalue problem
% for the surface Laplace (Laplace-Beltrami) operator on the sphere; for 
% an alternative derivation see [2, Ch. 2].
% The Laplace-Beltrami operator can be expressed in the spherical 
% coordinates defined above as
% $$ \Delta = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}
% - \frac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} +
% \frac{1}{\sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial\lambda^2}. $$
% The spherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of this operator, with the
% property that for $\ell \geq 0$, 
% $$ \Delta Y_{\ell}^{m} = -\ell(\ell + 1) Y_{\ell}^{m},\;\; 
% -m\leq \ell \leq m. $$ 

%%
% Spherical harmonics can also be expressed in Cartesian form as
% polynomials of $x$, $y$, and $z$ [2, Ch. 2]. When viewed in this way, one
% finds that these polynomials all satisfy Laplace's equation in
% ${\bf R}^3$, i.e., they are _harmonic_. This is where the name
% spherical harmonics originates and it was first used by Thomson (Lord
% Kelvin) and Tait in their classic book _Treatise on Natural
% Philosophy_ [3, Appendix B].

%%
% If the normalization factors $a_{\ell}^{k}$, $\ell \geq 0$, $0
% \leq k \leq \ell$ in (1) are chosen as
% $$ a_{\ell}^{k} = \sqrt{\frac{(2\ell+1)(\ell-k)!}{4\pi(\ell+k)!}}, $$
% the set of spherical harmonics $\{Y_{\ell}^{m}\}$, $\ell=0,1,\ldots$, 
% $m = -\ell,\ldots,\ell$, is orthonormal, i.e., 
% $$ \int_{S^2} Y_{\ell}^{m}Y_{\ell'}^{m'}\,dS =
% \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \int_0^{\pi}
% Y_{\ell}^{m}(\lambda,\theta)Y_{\ell'}^{m'}(\lambda,\theta)
% \sin\theta\,d\theta d\lambda = \delta_{\ell\ell'}\delta_{mm'}, $$
% where $\delta_{st}=1$ for $s=t$ and $\delta_{st}=0$ otherwise.
% Furthermore, it can be shown that they form a complete orthonormal basis
% for the set of $L^{2}$ integrable functions on the sphere, denoted by
% $L^{2}({\bf S}^2)$ [2, Sec. 2.8].
% Thus, for any $f\in L^{2}({\bf S}^2)$, we have 
% $$
% f(\lambda,\theta) = \sum_{\ell=0}^{\infty}\sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell c_{\ell}^{m} Y_{\ell}^{m}(\lambda,\theta), \quad\quad (1) $$
% where 
% $$ c_{\ell}^m = \int_{S^2} f Y_{\ell}^m\,dS =
% \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \int_0^{\pi}
% f(\lambda,\theta)Y_{\ell}^m(\lambda,\theta)\,d\theta d\lambda,
% \quad\quad (2) $$
% and equality in (1) is understood in the mean-square 
% sense. Truncating the outer sum of (1) to $N$ gives 
% the degree $N$ spherical harmonic projection of $f$. This is the best 
% degree $N$ approximation of $f$ in the $L^2$ norm on the 
% sphere among all harmonic polynomials in ${\bf R}^3$ of degree 
% $N$ restricted to the sphere [2, Ch. 4].  A spherical harmonic projection
% gives essentially uniform resolution of a function over the sphere in a
% similar way to a trigonometric (Fourier) projection of a $2\pi$
% periodic function in one dimension.

%% 2. Spherical harmonics in Spherefun
% While spherical harmonic expansions have many properties that make them 
% mathematically appealing for representing functions on the sphere,
% Spherefun does not rely on them.  Instead, it combines
% the double Fourier sphere method with a low rank technique (based on 
% a structure-preserving Gaussian elimination procedure) 
% for approximating functions on the sphere to approximately machine 
% precision [4]. This hybrid method allows for fast, highly adaptive
% discretizations based on the FFT, with no setup cost.  While fast
% spherical harmonic transforms are available [5], the precomputation cost
% for these algorithms is currently too high to be used as the primary 
% technology underlying approximations in Spherefun.

%%
% Nevertheless, given the importance of spherical harmonics in many
% applications, Spherefun allows one to compute with spherical harmonics. 
% In this and the next four sections we discuss some properties of 
% spherical harmonics and show how Spherefun can be used to easily verify 
% them.

%%
% The command |sphharm| constructs a spherical harmonic of a
% given degree and order. For example, $Y_{17}^{13}$ can be constructed and 
% plotted as follows:
Y17 = spherefun.sphharm(17,13);
plot(Y17), colorbar, axis off

%%
% We can verify that this function is an eigenfunction of the surface 
% Laplacian with eigenvalue $-\ell(\ell+1) = -17(18)$:
norm(laplacian(Y17)-(-17*18)*Y17)

%%
% We can also verify the orthonormality of spherical harmonics on the sphere
% using |sum2|, which computes the surface integral of a function over 
% the sphere: 
Y13 = spherefun.sphharm(13,7);
sum2(Y13.*Y17)
sum2(Y13.*Y13)
sum2(Y17.*Y17)

%% 
% Spherical harmonics become increasing oscillatory as their degree 
% increases, similarly to trigonometric polynomials. 
% Here is a plot of the real spherical harmonics $Y_{\ell}^{m}$, with
% $\ell=0,\ldots,4$ and $0\leq m \leq \ell$, illustrating this behavior.
% Black contour lines have been included indicating the zero curves of 
% each spherical harmonic, which highlights their transition from positive
% to negative values.
N = 4;
for l = 0:N
    for m = 0:l
        Y = spherefun.sphharm(l,m);
        subplot(N+1,N+1,l*(N+1)+m+1), plot(Y), hold on 
        contour(Y,[0 0],'k-'), axis off, hold off
    end
end

%%
% The negative order real spherical harmonics are similar to the positive 
% order ones, differing only by a rotation about the polar axis.

%% 3. Computing spherical harmonic coefficients
% The cost of computing all the spherical harmonic
% coefficients up to degree $N$ of a function directly using an
% approximation of (2) scales like $O(N^4)$.  If $f$ is of low
% rank, then the coefficients can be obtained in $O(N^3)$ operations using
% a fast multiplication algorithm and the \verb|sum2| command in Spherefun. As
% noted above, fast $O(N^2\log N)$ algorithms are available for this task
% [5], but these are not yet implemented in Spherefun.

%%
% As an example, consider the restriction of a Gaussian in ${\bf R}^3$, 
% $$ f(x,y,z) = \exp\left(-\frac{(x-x_0)^2 +
% (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2}{\sigma^2}\right), $$
% to ${\bf S}^2$.  Here, we center the Gaussian at a 
% random point ${\bf x}_0 = (x_0,y_0,z_0)\in{\bf S}^2$, i.e., 
% $x_0^2+y_0^2+z_0^2=1$, and choose $\sigma = 0.4$.
rng(10)
x0 = 2*rand-1; y0 = sqrt(1-x0^2)*(2*rand-1); z0 = sqrt(1-x0^2-y0^2);
sig = 0.4;
f = spherefun(@(x,y,z) exp(-((x-x0).^2+(y-y0).^2+(z-z0).^2)/sig^2) )
clf, plot(f), title('A Gaussian on the sphere'), colorbar, axis off

%%
% The numerical rank of this function is only 23, so we consider it to be 
% a low rank function. The spherical harmonic coefficients of $f$ up to 
% degree 12 can be computed as follows:
N = 12; k = 1;
coeffs = zeros((N+1)^2,3);
for l = 0:N
    for m = -l:l
        Y = spherefun.sphharm(l,m);
        coeffs(k,1) = sum2(f.*Y);
        coeffs(k,2:3) = [l m];
        k = k + 1;
    end
end

%%
% Since the Gaussian is analytic, the spherical harmonic coefficients decay
% exponentially with increasing $\ell$ [2], as the following figure
% illustrates:

set(gca,'ZScale','log'), set(gca,'Xdir','reverse'), view([-13 18])

%%
% Here is the degree 7 spherical harmonic projection of the Gaussian 
% function given above.
fproj = spherefun([]);
k = 1;
for l = 0:7
    for m = -l:l
        fproj = fproj + coeffs(k,1)*spherefun.sphharm(l,m);
        k = k + 1;
    end
end
plot(fproj), title('Degree 7 spherical harmonic projection')

%%
% As mentioned earlier, this is the best $L^2$ approximation of
% $f$ of degree 7 on the sphere. Here is what the error between $f$ and the 
% projection looks like, followed by its $L^2({\bf S}^2)$ norm.

%% 4. Zonal kernels and the Funk-Hecke formula
% A kernel $\Psi:{\bf S}^2 \times {\bf S}^2 \rightarrow {\bf R}$ is
% called a zonal kernel on the sphere if for any
% $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\in{\bf S}^2$, it can be expressed
% as a function of the inner product of $\mathbf{x}$ and
% $\mathbf{y}$, i.e.,
% $$ \Psi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \psi(\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{y}), $$
% where $\psi:[-1,1]\rightarrow\mathbf{R}$. For example, the Gaussian 
% kernel 
% $$ \Psi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) =
% \exp\left(-\frac{\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\|_2^2}{\sigma^2}\right) $$
% restricted to the sphere is a zonal kernel since
% $$ \|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\|_2 = \sqrt{2-2\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{y}} $$
% for any $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\in{\bf S}^2$.  So, for the 
% Gaussian,
% $$ \psi(t) = \exp\left(-\frac{2(1-t)}{\sigma^2}\right). \quad (3) $$

%%
% Zonal kernels have the beautiful property that, for a fixed
% $\mathbf{y}\in{\bf S}^2$, their spherical harmonic coefficients
% satisfy
% $$
% c_{\ell}^{m} = \int_{S^2}
% \psi(\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{y})Y_{\ell}^{m}(\mathbf{x})dS = \frac{4\pi a_{\ell}}{2\ell+1} Y_{\ell}^{m}(\mathbf{y}), \quad (4) $$
% where $a_{\ell}$ are the coefficients in the Legendre series expansion of
% $\psi$, i.e., 
% $$ \psi(t) = \sum_{\ell=0}^{\infty} a_{\ell} P_{k}(t),\;\hbox{where}\; 
% a_{\ell} = \frac{2\ell+1}{2}\int_{-1}^{1}\psi(t)P_{\ell}(t)dt.
% $$
% Here, $P_{\ell}$ denotes the Legendre polynomial of degree $\ell$.  This
% property is known as the _Funk-Hecke formula_ and holds for any $\psi \in
% L^1(-1,1)$ [2, Sec. 2.5].

%%
% Equation (4) implies that, for a fixed $\ell$, the
% values $c_{\ell}^{m}/Y_{\ell}^{m}(\mathbf{y})$, for $-\ell \leq m \leq \ell$, 
% are all equal. We can verify this for the Gaussian by 
% taking the spherical harmonic coefficients computed previously and 
% scaling them by the appropriate value of $Y_{\ell}^{m}(\mathbf{x}_0)$.
k = 1;
zonalCoeffs = zeros((N+1).^2,1);
for l = 0:N
    for m = -l:l
        Y = spherefun.sphharm(l,m);
        zonalCoeffs(k) = coeffs(k,1)/Y(x0,y0,z0);
        k = k+1;
    end
end
stem3(coeffs(:,2),coeffs(:,3),abs(zonalCoeffs),'filled')
set(gca,'ZScale','log'), set(gca,'Xdir','reverse'), view([-13 18])
xlabel('$\ell$','Interpreter','Latex'), ylabel('m'), zlabel('|coeffs|')

%%
% Moreover, we can check the accuracy of the computed spherical harmonic
% coefficients by using the Legendre expansion for $\psi$ in
% (3).  The coefficients in this expansion are computed
% in [6] and are given by
% $$ a_{\ell} =
% \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}\sigma e^{-2/\sigma^2}(2\ell+1)I_{\ell+1/2}(2/\sigma^2),
% $$
% where $I_{\nu}$ denotes the modified Bessel function of the first kind of
% order $\nu$.  The
% maximum error in the computed spherical harmonic coefficients of the
% Gaussian in Section 3 is then
k = 1;
coeffsExact = zeros((N+1).^2,1);
for l = 0:N
    for m = -l:l
        Y = spherefun.sphharm(l,m);
        a = sqrt(pi)/2*sig*exp(-2/sig^2)*(2*l+1)*besseli(l+1/2,2/sig^2);
        coeffsExact(k) = 4*pi/(2*l+1)*a*Y(x0,y0,z0);
        k = k+1;
    end
end
max(abs(coeffs(:,1)-coeffsExact))

%% 5. The Addition Theorem
% A related result to the Funk-Hecke formula is the _Addition Theorem_
% for spherical harmonics [2, Sec 2.2].  This theorem says that for any
% $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\in{\bf S}^2$ and all $\ell=0,1,\ldots,$
% $$ \frac{4\pi}{2\ell + 1} \sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} 
% Y_{\ell}^m(\mathbf{x})Y_{\ell}^m(\mathbf{y}) = 
% P_{\ell}(\mathbf{x}^{T}\mathbf{y}), $$
% where $P_{\ell}$ is the Legendre polynomial of degree $\ell$.  The
% left-hand side of this equation for $\ell = 14$ can be constructed as 
% follows:
rng(13)
x0 = 2*rand-1; y0 = sqrt(1-x0^2)*(2*rand-1); z0 = sqrt(1-x0^2-y0^2);
lhs = spherefun([]);
l = 14;
for m=-l:l
    Y = spherefun.sphharm(l,m);
    lhs = lhs + Y.*Y(x0,y0,z0);
end
lhs = 4*pi/(2*l+1)*lhs;
plot(lhs), colorbar, axis off

%%
% The right-hand side can be constructed using |legpoly|:
p15 = legpoly(l);
t = @(x,y,z) (x*x0 + y*y0 + z*z0);
rhs = spherefun(@(x,y,z) feval(p15,t(x,y,z)));
plot(rhs), colorbar, axis off

%%
% Is the theorem correct? At least in this case, yes!
norm(lhs-rhs)

%% 6. Platonic solids
% Certain low order spherical harmonics can be combined so that they have
% the same rotational symmetries as certain platonic solids.  These
% combinations of spherical harmonics play a key role in the linear
% stability analysis of partial differential equations in spherical
% geometries; see, for example, the work of Busse on thermal convection in
% spherical shells [7].  The combination with tetrahedral symmetry is 
% given by
Y = spherefun.sphharm(3,2);
plot(Y), hold on, contour(Y,[0.1 0.1],'k-'), axis off, hold off

%%
% The combination with octahedral symmetry is given by
Y = spherefun.sphharm(4,0) + sqrt(5/7)*spherefun.sphharm(4,4);
plot(Y), hold on, contour(Y,[0 0],'k-'), axis off, hold off

%%
% And the combination with icosahedral symmetry is given by
Y = spherefun.sphharm(6,0) + sqrt(14/11)*spherefun.sphharm(6,5);
plot(Y), hold on, contour(Y,[0 0],'k-'), axis off, hold off
