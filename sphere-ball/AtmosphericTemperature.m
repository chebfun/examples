%% 1. Introduction 
% Spherefun is a part of Chebfun for computing with functions on the
% sphere. The underlying approximation scheme is based on representing
% functions on the sphere by certain structure-preserving low rank
% approximants [1]. Mathematically, most functions are of infinite rank on
% the sphere with a notable exception being spherical harmonic functions.
% However, many functions are numerically of low rank. When a function is
% of low rank, Spherefun is surprisingly efficient.

%% 2. Is surface air temperature of low rank? 
% Recently, we were asked: Is the surface air temperature of the earth 
% of low rank? In this example, we apply Spherefun to one atmospheric 
% dataset and find that it can be well approximated by a
% function of moderate rank.

%% 
% Here is a data set on a 529x1024 latitude-longitude grid containing the 
% global atmospheric temperature (in Kelvin) of earth on 12-July-2005
% obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
% Earth System Research Laboratory:
load AtmosphericData;

%% 
% We can use Spherefun to construct an approximation of $f$ and visualize 
% the dataset: 

f = spherefun( Temp ); 
surf(f), colormap(jet), colorbar, axis off, view([50 0]), hold on
spherefun.plotEarth('k-'), hold off 

%%
% The last line includes the landmasses of earth on the plot.

%% 
% We can find out more about the underlying data set by looking at the rank: 

f

%% 
% Spherefun calculated the rank of $f$ as 185.  Since the dataset is of
% size 529x1024, this shows that the low rank representation is achieving
% some useful compression of the original dataset, although the results are
% not as dramatic as one often sees for smooth functions (see [2] for more
% detailed discussions).

%% 3. Investigating the atmospheric temperature
% There are over a hundred commands in Spherefun and we can now 
% investigate properties of atmospheric temperature over the earth. Before
% we begin, we convert the function to units of Celsius by subtracting
% 273.15.

f = f - 273.15;

%% 
% What is the mean temperature of the earth? 

mean2( f )

%% 
% What is the temperature at the North and South poles? 

f( 0, 0, 1 ) % North pole
f( 0, 0, -1) % South pole 

%% 
% This confirms that the atmospheric temperature data was taken during
% summer in the Northern hemisphere.

%% 
% What is the temperature along the equator? 

plot( f( :, pi/2 ) )   % In spherical coordinates. 
xlabel('Longitude, \lambda'), ylabel('Temperature (Celsius)')

%% 
% What do the isolines look line? 

contour( f, -40:5:40, 'LineWidth', 2 ), axis off, view([50 5]), hold on
spherefun.plotEarth('k-'), hold off 

%% 
% What is the zonal mean temperature?

zonalMean = mean(f,2);
plot(zonalMean), xlim([0 pi])
xlabel('Co-latitude, \theta'), ylabel('Temperature (Celsius)')

%% 4. Poisson solver 
% We can also compute the steady heat profile with an external 
% source, assuming there are no internal heat sinks or sources.
% This requires solving Poisson's equation on the sphere.

%% 
% The solution to Poisson's equation only makes sense if the right hand 
% side has mean zero.  So, we first subtract a constant from the external 
% heat source to ensure it has a mean of zero. For fun, we take the source
% as $f$ from above. 

[n, m] = length( f ); 
steadyHeat = spherefun.poisson( -(f - mean2(f)), 0, m, n ); 
plot( f ), colormap(jet), axis off, view([50 0]), hold on
spherefun.plotEarth('k-'), title('Original dataset'), snapnow, hold off

plot( steadyHeat ), colormap(jet), axis off, view([50 0]), hold on
spherefun.plotEarth('k-'), title('Steady Heat'), snapnow, hold off

%% 5. Scale-space selection using a Gaussian filter
% It is common to smooth data by applying a Gaussian filter. This type of
% filter also provides a means of analyzing data at various scales and
% is particularly appealing as it does not introduce artificial structures
% in the data, such as magnifying local extrema. 

%%
% This idea is applied in [3] to global climate data collected on the 
% surface of the sphere, such as air surface temperature, to identify
% features in the data that are robust over multiple scales. The |smooth|
% command in Spherefun uses a Gaussian filter to smooth a function f. It 
% has in optional parameter $\sigma$ that determines the length scale 
% (as measured in radians at the equator of the unit sphere) at which
% the smoothing occurs.

%%
% We can repeat the experiments of [3] easily on the surface air
% temperature with this command.  For example, in this paper the authors
% analyze smoothing at scales of 2, 10, and 20 degrees, which in radians
% correspond to $\sigma$ values
sig = [2 10 20]*pi/180;

%%
% The smoothed temperature at these scales, together with original 
% temperature are computed and plotted as

surf(f), colormap(jet), axis off, view([50 0]), hold on
spherefun.plotEarth('k-'), title('Original Temp.'), snapnow, hold off

for j=1:3
    fsmooth = gaussfilt( f, sig(j) );
    surf(fsmooth), colormap(jet), axis off, view([50 0]), hold on
    spherefun.plotEarth('k-')
    title(['Smoothed Temp., \sigma=' num2str(sig(j)*180/pi) ' degrees'])
    snapnow, hold off
end

%%
% This type of filtering has also been used on CT scans of the brain
% to detect certain abnormalities [4].
