%% 1. Introduction
% The Rayleigh quotient plays a key role in the study of eigenvalues of symmetric
% matrices.  If $A$ is a real $n\mbox{-by-}n$ symmetric matrix then the 
% Rayleigh quotient is defined as
% $$ r(x) = \frac{x^{T} A x}{x^T x}, $$
% for any $n$-dimensional real vector $x\neq 0$.  
% A key property of the Rayleigh quotient is that if $x$ is an eigenvector
% of $A$ then $r(x)$ gives the corresponding eigenvalue.  Note that we can 
% naturally extend the Rayleigh quotient to more general 
% matrices, but our focus in this example is on real symmetric ones.

%%
% If we restrict our attention to unit vectors, i.e. $\|x\|=1$, 
% then the Rayleigh quotient
% can simply be written
% $$ q(x) = x^{T} A x. $$
% In this way, we can view the Rayleigh quotient as a function defined on
% the $(n-1)$-dimensional sphere.  Here is an example for the 2-sphere:
rng(52509);
A = 10*(2*rand(3)-1); A = 0.5*(A+A');
q = spherefun(@(x,y,z) [x,y,z]*A*[x;y;z],'vectorize');
plot(q), hold on, contour(q,20,'k-'), colorbar, hold off

%% 2. Maximum principle
% The following theorem tells us that the eigenvalues of $A$ are given by
% the maximum value of the restricted Rayleigh quotient $q$ on certain
% subspaces of the sphere.

%%
% _Theorem_(Maximum principle [2]) Let $A$ be a real $n\mbox{-by-}n$
% symmetric matrix. The largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of $A$ is given by
% $$ \lambda_1 = \max_{\|x\|=1} q(x) $$ 
% and the location where this maximum occurs, $\lambda_1 = q(x_1)$, is the 
% corresponding eigenvector.  Furthermore, the remaining $n-1$ eigenvalues
% $\lambda_2 \geq \lambda_3 \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n$, are given by
% $$ \lambda_k = \left\{\max_{\|x\|=1} q(x) \bigr| <x,x_j> = 0,\;
% j=1,\ldots,k-1\right\}, $$
% where $x_j = q(\lambda_j)$ is the eigenvector corresponding $\lambda_j$.

%%
% Our goal in this example is to demonstrate this theorem in the case of
% the 2-sphere.

%% 3. Demonstration of maximum principle
% The theorem says that the largest eigenvalue of $A$, $\lambda_1$, is given
% by the maximum value of $q$.  This can be computed this as follows:
[lambda1,loc] = max2(q);
lambda1

%%
% We can verify the result against MATLAB's |eig| function:
lambdaA = sort(eig(A),1,'descend');
error = abs(lambdaA(1)-lambda1)

%%
% The entries of the corresponding eigenvector, $x_1$, are given by the 
% Cartesian coordinates of the location of $\lambda_1$.
s2c = @(u) [cos(u(1))*sin(u(2)); sin(u(1))*sin(u(2)); cos(u(2))];
x1 = s2c(loc);
plot(q), hold on
plot3(x1(1),x1(2),x1(3),'r.',MS,ms), hold off

%%
% The maximum principle theorem says that the next two eigenvalues of $A$
% must lie on the great circle formed by the plane that is normal to $x_1$
% and passes through the origin.  This great circle can be parameterized 
% and plotted as follows:
xp = @(t) cos(loc(1))*cos(loc(2))*cos(t)-sin(loc(1))*sin(t);
yp = @(t) sin(loc(1))*cos(loc(2))*cos(t)+cos(loc(1))*sin(t);
zp = @(t) -sin(loc(2))*cos(t);

t = linspace(-pi,pi,501);
plot(q), hold on
plot3(xp(t),yp(t),zp(t),'r-',LW,lw)
plot3(x1(1),x1(2),x1(3),'r.',MS,ms), hold off

%%
% Let $f$ be equal to the value of $q$ on this great circle.
f = chebfun(@(t) feval(q,xp(t),yp(t),zp(t)),[-pi pi],'trig');
plot(f,LW,lw)

%%
% The maximum value of $f$ on this great circle gives the next largest
% eigenvalue $\lambda_2$.
[lambda2,loc] = max(f);
x2 = [xp(loc); yp(loc); zp(loc)];  % corresponding eigenvector
lambda2
error = abs(lambdaA(2)-lambda2)

%%
% According to the maximum principle theorem, the smallest eigenvalue,
% $\lambda_3$, is then given as the value of $q$ at the vector orthogonal to $x_2$
% on the great circle.  This is simply the value of $f$ shifted by $\pi/2$
% from the location of $\lambda_2$ on the great circle.
lambda3 = f(loc+pi/2);
x3 = [xp(loc+pi/2); yp(loc+pi/2); zp(loc+pi/2)]; % corresponding eigenvector
lambda3
error = abs(lambdaA(3)-lambda3)

%%
% Here are the eigenvectors and locations of the values of the eigenvalues
% of $A$, together with a plot of $q$.
plot(q), hold on
X = repmat([zeros(2,3);nan(1,3)],[3 1]);
X([2 5 8],:) = [x1';x2';x3'];
plot3(X(:,1),X(:,2),X(:,3),'r.-',LW,lw,MS,ms)
axis([-1 1 -1 1 -1 1]), alpha(0.8), hold off

%% 4. Eigenvalues and the vanishing gradient of $q$ 
% We conclude this example with a demonstration of another property of the
% restricted Rayleigh quotient related to the maximum principle theorem.  The
% property is that the eigenvalues of $q$ occur where the surface gradient
% of $q$ vanishes [2]. To demonstrate this, we plot the zero-level curves
% of the three components of the surface gradient of $q$ together with the
% location of the eigenvalues.
Gq = grad(q);
contour(Gq(1),[0 0],'k-'), hold on
contour(Gq(2),[0 0],'b-')
contour(Gq(3),[0 0],'m-'), 
plot3(X(:,1),X(:,2),X(:,3),'r.-',LW,lw,MS,ms), hold off
