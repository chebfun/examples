                The quickest way to solve your problem with Chebfun may be to find a similar problem someone else has solved to use as a template. This page connects you to dozens of such templates, called Chebfun Examples. Each example is an M-file producing text and/or graphical output which executes, in most cases, in less than 5 seconds. You can also execute the example with Matlab's PUBLISH command to get a more informative story. Type open(publish('filename')) to see the quickest version on your screen or publish('filename','latex') for a better formatted LaTeX version, which will appear in a directory called html. The published output is also available for direct download as a pdf file.
