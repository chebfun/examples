%%  1. Introduction
% Consider a circular drum of radius 1. When struck,
% vibrational patterns traverse across the surface of the drum, and
% at resonant frequencies, these patterns form 
% what are called _standing_, or _stationary_, waves. 
% We refer to the functions that describe these standing waves 
% as _harmonic_ functions. The harmonic functions form an 
% orthonormal basis for a useful class of functions on the unit disk. 
% While the harmonics are not used within Diskfun's constructor for a variety 
% of reasons [6], they can be accessed easily with the 
% |diskfun.harmonic| command. In this example, we explore the harmonic 
% functions and use them to approximate 
% solutions to the wave equation on the disk. 

%% 2. Deriving the harmonics
% An idealized drum consists of a membrane with negligible 
% and uniform thickness, clamped to a circular wire frame 
% so that the displacement at the boundary is zero. 
% Letting $\theta \in [-\pi, \pi]$, $r \in [0, 1]$, and $t \geq 0$ represent 
% angular, radial and time variables, respectively,
% the displacement of the membrane, $u(\theta,r, t)$, will satisfy the wave 
% equation with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. In polar coordinates, this
% is expressed as follows: 
% $$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = 
% c^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial r^2} +
% \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial u}{\partial r} +
% \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \theta^2} \right), 
% \quad \quad 
%  u(\theta, 1, t) = 0, \quad \quad (1) $$ 
% where $c$ is selected as a positive constant related to the speed at 
% which tranverse waves travel across the membrane. 
% We will choose $c=1$ for convenience.
% We must also specify a set of initial conditions. In this case, we select
% a smooth function on the disk as the initial displacement of the membrane,  
% and let the initial 
% velocity be zero everywhere, so that
% $$ u(\theta, r, 0) = f(\theta, r), \quad \quad
%  u_t(\theta, r, 0) = 0. \quad \quad (2) $$
%%
% Using separation of variables, 
% one finds the following solutions to the problem described above:
% $$ u_{mn}(\theta, r, t) = 
% A_{mn}\cos(c\lambda_{mn} t)J_m(\lambda_{mn}
% r)\cos(m \theta), \quad m \geq 0, n \geq 1, \quad \quad (3) $$ 
% $$ v_{mn}(\theta, r, t) = 
% B_{mn}\cos(c\lambda_{mn} t)J_m(\lambda_{mn}
% r) \sin(m\theta), \quad m \geq 1, n \geq 1, \quad \quad (4) $$
% where $J_m$ is the $m$ th order Bessel function of 
% the first kind.
%  When $t=0$ and $A_{mn}$ and $B_{mn}$ are selected as normalization factors, 
% these are eigenfunctions of Laplace's 
% equation on the disk, with eigenvalues
% $-\lambda^2_{mn}$, where $\lambda_{mn}$ is the $n$ th positive root 
% of the function $J_m(r)$ [2].
%%
% In Diskfun, we can construct these functions 
% using |diskfun.harmonic|. The parameters passed to the function are 
% $m$ and $n$, respectively, in (3) and (4). If $m$ is chosen 
% as a nonnegative integer, then the function constructed is 
% $u_{mn} = A_{mn} J_m(\lambda_{mn}
% r) \cos(m\theta)$, where $A_{mn}$ is the normalization factor.  
% For $m<0$, the function $v_{|m|n} = 
% B_{|m|n} J_{|m|}(\lambda_{|m|n}
% r) \sin(|m|\theta)$ is constructed. Here is how we 
% construct the lowest order harmonic function: 

 u01 = diskfun.harmonic(0,1)
%%
% We can verify that |u01| is an eigenfunction of Laplace's equation. The
% associated eigenvalue is related to the first positive zero of the function
% $J_0(r)$. We find this using |roots| in Chebfun, and then use |lap| to
% compute the Laplacian on the disk. 

lam = roots(chebfun(@(r) besselj(0,r), [0 pi]));

norm( lap(u01)+(lam)^2*u01 )

%%
% Below, we plot |u01| along with a few other harmonic functions. 
% The harmonic functions with $m=0$ correspond to initial displacements
% in the vibrating drum problem where the drum is struck exactly in the 
% center. This creates vibrational patterns that are radially symmetric.

subplot(1,2,1)
a = -100.4; b = 51.6;

% Other parameter choices correspond to initial displacements that do not 
% guarantee radial symmetry. Here are what some of them look like.

%%
% These functions all satisfy homogeneous Dirichlet conditions, but we can
% also compute with harmonic functions that satisfy homogeneous
% Neumann conditions: 

uN21 = diskfun.harmonic(2,1, 'neumann');
uN34 = diskfun.harmonic(3,4, 'neumann');

subplot(1,2,2)
plot(uN34), axis off, view(a,b), title('u34 with Neumann bc')
%%
% The normalized harmonic functions form an orthonormal basis; we can check 
% this property using |sum2|, which performs integration over the unit disk: 
%%
int1 = sum2(u01.*u02)
int2 = sum2(v22.*u711)
int3 = sum2(u03.*u03)


%% 3. Approximations with harmonic functions
% Any function that
% is square integrable on the disk and satisfies homogeneous Dirichlet 
% conditions can be expressed using the following series expansion [2]: 
% $$ f(\theta, r) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} J_0(\lambda_{0,n} r) +
% \sum_{m = 1}^{\infty} \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}  
% J_m(\lambda_{mn} r) \left( a_{mn}\cos(m\theta) + 
% b_{mn} \sin(m\theta) \right). \quad\quad (5) $$
% In this example, we truncate the above expansion to approximate a modified 
% Gaussian function $f$ that is homogeneous on the boundary of the disk:
%%
f = diskfun(@(x,y) 20*(1-x.^2-y.^2).^2.*exp(-6*(x+.25).^2-6*(y-.2).^2));
clf
plot(f), title('f'), axis off, colorbar

%%
% The coefficients in (5) can be computed directly using the 
% normalized harmonic functions $u_{mn}$ and $v_{mn}$, as 
% $$ a_{mn} =
% \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\int_{0}^{1} u_{mn}(\theta, r) f(\theta, r) r \, dr \, d \theta,
% \quad \quad (6) $$
% and
% $$ b_{mn} = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\int_{0}^{1} 
% v_{mn}(\theta, r) f(\theta, r) r \, dr \, d \theta. \quad \quad (7) $$ 
% The following code computes the coefficients for $0 \leq m \leq 7$  
% and $1 \leq n \leq 7$:   
%%
N = 7; NN = 7; k = 1;
csz = (N+1).*NN*2-NN;
coeffs = zeros(csz,3);
for m = 0:N
    for n = 1:NN 
        for j = 1:(1+double(~(m==0)))
            H = diskfun.harmonic((-1)^j*m,n);
            coeffs(k,1) = sum2(f.*H);   
            coeffs(k,2:3) = [(-1)^j*m n];
            k = k + 1;
        end
    end
end
%%
% We examine the decay of the coefficients below, using the convention
% that $m < 0$ denotes the coefficient $b_{|m|n}$ in (7). Convergence
% in $n$ depends not only on the smoothness of
% $f$, but also on whether the Fourier coefficients of $f$, which are functions
% of $r$, satisfy additional boundary conditions related to the Laplacian 
% operator (see [1]).  
%%
stem3(coeffs(:,2),coeffs(:,3),abs(coeffs(:,1)),'filled')
set(gca,'ZScale','log'), view([1.205e2,38])
xlabel('m'), ylabel('n'), zlabel('abs. value of coeffs')
%%
% Now that we have the coefficients, we can compute the terms of the
% series. Here, we will approximate $f$ by truncating (5)
% so that $0 \leq m \leq 5$ and $1 \leq n \leq 5$. 
%%
coeffs = coeffs(abs(coeffs(:,2)) < 6 & abs(coeffs(:,3)) < 6, :);
[csz,~] =size(coeffs);

fproj = diskfun([]);
for k = 1:csz
    H = diskfun.harmonic(coeffs(k,2),coeffs(k,3));
    fproj = fproj + coeffs(k,1)*H;
end
%%
% In this case, the approximation is accurate only up to two digits:
errf = norm(f-fproj)
%% 
% Below, we plot the approximation to $f$, as well as the error function.  
subplot(1,2,1)
plot(fproj), title('f'), axis off, colorbar
subplot(1,2,2)
plot(f-fproj), title('f: error'), axis off, colorbar, snapnow
%%
% The expansion in (5) can be modified so that functions with 
% nonhomogenous boundary conditions can also be expressed in terms of the 
% harmonic functions. Additionally, there are ways to compute the 
% coefficients in (5) more efficiently [5]. 

%% 4. An analytic solution to the wave equation
% We can use the superposition principle to state the general solution to the
% vibrating drum problem described in (1). Given initial conditions as 
% in (2), the solution to (1) is 
% $$ u(\theta, r, t) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} a_{0,n} \cos(c\lambda_{0,n} t)
% J_0(\lambda_{0,n}r) + 
% \sum_{m = 1}^{\infty} \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} 
% \cos(c\lambda_{mn} t)J_m(\lambda_{mn}r) \left( a_{mn} \cos(m\theta) 
% +  b_{mn}  \sin(m\theta) \right). \quad \quad (8) $$
% Recall that $c$ is a constant and in this example, we have selected $c=1$.  
% The coefficients $a_{mn}$ and $b_{mn}$ depend on the initial displacement 
% $u(t, r, 0) = f(t,r)$. If we let $t=0$ in (8), we see that they are given
% by (6) and (7).
% More generally, any vibrational pattern producible on 
% the drum is in fact a linear combination of harmonic functions.
%%
% In this example, we choose $f$ from Section 3 as the initial displacement,  
% and plot an approximation to $u$ using the harmonic functions. While
% this is a theoretically interesting example that illuminates the role of
% the harmonic functions in solutions to the wave equation, 
% it is far from numerically efficient. 
% We therefore begin by reducing the number of coefficients 
% used in our approximation to $f$, so that in (5),
% $0 \leq m \leq 3$ and $1 \leq n \leq 3$: 

coeffs = coeffs(abs(coeffs(:,2)) < 4 & abs(coeffs(:,3)) < 4, :);
[csz, ~] = size(coeffs); 
NN = 3;N = 3; 
%%
% We require the value $\lambda_{mn}$, 
% which is the $n$ th positive root of the Bessel function $J_m(r)$, 
% for each $(m,n)$. 
% We compute these using |roots|, 
% and bound the interval searched over with simple estimates [3, 4]. 

broots = zeros(csz, 3);

% first compute for L = 0
Jzero = roots(chebfun(@(x) besselj(0,x), [sqrt((3/4)^2*pi^2) (NN)*pi]));
broots(1:NN, :) = [ Jzero, zeros(NN,1),(1:NN)']; 

% now compute for L = 1,2,3
k = NN+1;
for L = 1:N
    Jzero = roots(chebfun(@(x) besselj(L,x), [sqrt((3/4)^2*pi^2+L^2) (NN+L/2)*pi]));
    broots(k:2:k+2*NN-1, :) = [Jzero -L*ones(NN,1), (1:NN)'];
    broots(k+1:2:k+2*NN, :) = [Jzero L*ones(NN,1), (1:NN)'];
    k = k+2*NN;
end

%%
% The following code computes the solution. Since the code is slow to execute,
% it is best to first store a sequence of diskfuns representing the 
% solution at $t = 0, 0.1, 0.2, \cdots 4.0$. These can then be plotted
% consecutively to visualize the solution through time. 

tm = linspace(0, 4, 41); 
k = 1;
T = diskfun([]);
u=cell(1,length(tm)); 

for i = 1:length(tm)
    t = tm(i); 
    for k = 1:csz
        H = coeffs(k,1)*diskfun.harmonic(coeffs(k,2), coeffs(k,3)); 
        T = T + cos(broots(k,1).*t).*H;         
    end
    u{i} = T;
end
%%
% The loop below will plot the
% solution at every timestep; we display only a few snapshots in time
% here.
